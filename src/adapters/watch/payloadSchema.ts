/**
 * Watch ↔ iPhone WatchConnectivity (WC) message envelopes — protocol layer.
 *
 * Slice 13d / D3 (ADR-0019 § Slice 13d Amendment). This file is the
 * *protocol-only* slice of D3 — pure TypeScript types + a tiny factory and
 * a discriminating type guard. The `connectivity.ts` bridge wrapper that
 * actually imports `react-native-watch-connectivity` lands later in the D3
 * commit chain (gated on the D0 spike outcome — Branch A vs Branch B).
 *
 * Why split the schema out:
 *   - Jest runs under `testEnvironment: node`, so any module that
 *     `import`s a native bridge at the top level explodes in tests. By
 *     keeping the schema pure, we can unit-test the wire format without
 *     mocks. The `connectivity.ts` wrapper will lazy-`require()` the
 *     native module the same way `src/adapters/healthkit/permission.ts`
 *     does (see L41-48 there for the canonical pattern).
 *   - Watch-side Swift code mirrors these structures via
 *     `WCPayload.swift` (D4/D5). Keeping the TS shape narrow + named
 *     gives the Swift port an unambiguous source-of-truth.
 *
 * Design rules baked into the envelope (per ADR-0019 § Q6):
 *   1. Payload values must be JSON primitives only — `string`, `number`,
 *      `boolean`, `null`, arrays of those, or objects whose own fields
 *      satisfy the same rule. No `Date`, no `Map`, no `Set`, no
 *      `function`, no `undefined`, no `symbol`. Anything that
 *      `JSON.stringify` would silently drop or stringify wrong is out.
 *   2. Time-of-event is always a `number` (epoch milliseconds). The
 *      factory accepts `Date` for ergonomic call-sites and converts.
 *   3. Every envelope carries a unique `msgId` so the receiver can
 *      dedupe via the ring buffer (≥256 slots) specified in Q7.
 *
 * The 16 message kinds come straight from ADR-0019 § Slice 13d
 * Amendment table + Agent F codebase inventory (D3 section + the kinds
 * referenced by D5-D24). See per-kind doc-comments below for the
 * decision that introduced each kind.

 *
 * D31 (2026-05-29 late) — `start-resolve` added as Watch → iPhone

 * backstop. Carries a monotonic `rev` so the iPhone receiver
 * (`onLiveMirror`) drops out-of-order / stale redeliveries. Fixes the
 * "又慢、又亂、時有時無（尤其遞減組）" live-sync regression that came
 * from riding applicationContext alone (latest-replace, OS-paced,

 * self-heals on the next push; `end-session` is the correctness backstop.

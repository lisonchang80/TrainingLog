/**
 * cast-session — iPhone → Watch "投影 Watch" push orchestrator (2026-06-27).
 *
 * The user is mid-session on the iPhone and taps 投影 Watch in the in-session
 * ⋯ menu to push the running session onto the wrist. This is distinct from:
 *   - D6 `start-from-iphone` (never wired — `pushStartToWatch` sends an empty
 *     `{}` snapshot AND the Watch has no consumer for that kind, which is why
 *     the first 投影 Watch attempt "跳已送出 但手錶無反應": the envelope left the
 *     phone but the Watch had nowhere to receive it).
 *   - D29 `live-mirror` (only PROJECTS onto an ALREADY-open Watch session — it
 *     cannot OPEN a session on an idle/picker Watch).
 *
 * `cast-session` carries the FULL session-tree snapshot and tells an idle /
 * picker Watch to NAVIGATE INTO the session (the Watch reuses its
 * start-from-watch → `SetLoggerView(snapshot:)` swap). Wire shape is the
 * `snapshotToWire` start-from-watch shape (via `buildStartFromIphone`), NOT the
 * live-mirror omit-null projection — the Watch's `SessionSnapshot.swift`
 * Codable decodes the explicit-null shape.
 *
 * Transport — DUAL-FIRE (grill 2026-06-27, G1 = reachable-now + TUI backstop):
 *   - `sendUserInfo` (TUI / `transferUserInfo`) — fire-and-forget queued
 *     backstop. OS-durable: delivered when the Watch app next wakes, so the
 *     「已送出，手錶開啟後帶入」toast is literally true even when the Watch is
 *     asleep / unreachable right now (iOS cannot force-launch the Watch app).
 *   - `sendMessage` — the instant channel when the Watch is reachable. An
 *     explicit `{ok:true}` ack means the Watch adopted + navigated into the
 *     session NOW (→ `acked:true`, drives the success toast).
 * Both fire the SAME envelope (one `msgId`) so the Watch dedupes the duplicate
 * delivery via `seenMsgId` (same pattern as the D29 live-mirror dual-fire and
 * the connectivity ring-buffer dedup comment).
 *
 * Contract (Q11 silent-skip — mirrors `pushStartToWatch` / `pushEndToWatch`):
 *   - Never throws. Catches at the bridge boundary; returns a structured result.
 *   - Session row missing / snapshot unbuildable → `{acked:false, queued:false,
 *     code:'NO_SNAPSHOT'}`. (Should not happen for a genuine in-progress
 *     session; caller may toast a generic error.)
 *   - Reachable + `{ok:true}` ack within timeout → `{acked:true, queued:true}`.
 *   - Reachable but no positive `{ok:true}` ack → `{acked:false, queued:true,
 *     code:'ACK_NO_OK'}` (TUI backstop still queued).
 *   - Unreachable / unpaired / timeout / bridge error → `{acked:false,
 *     queued:true, code:<SendResult.code>}` (TUI backstop still queued — the
 *     cast will land when the Watch app next opens).
 *   - is_watch_tracked: flipped true whenever the cast is QUEUED (snapshot built
 *     + dual-fired), regardless of reachability — the durable cast WILL be
 *     adopted on the Watch's next wake, so the iPhone→Watch live-mirror gate
 *     (`index.tsx` refresh push, gated on the DB column) must open NOW. The ONLY
 *     exception is an explicit `{ok:false}` reply (Watch busy with another
 *     session). Decouples `acked` (synchronous adoption) from tracking (intent +
 *     durable queue). [2026-06-27 ⑤⑥ fix: queued/cold-launch cast opened the
 *     session on the wrist but never received subsequent iPhone edits.]

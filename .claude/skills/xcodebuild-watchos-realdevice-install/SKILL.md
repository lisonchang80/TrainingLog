description: Build + install a React Native + watchOS embedded app to a paired iPhone + Apple Watch from CLI. Triggers — "裝到 Watch", "install to iPhone real device", "Watch app 沒更新", "xcodebuild install 沒推到 device", or any time we need to deploy new Watch SwiftUI to the user's wrist for smoke. Owns paths under `ios/TrainingLog.xcworkspace`, `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TrainingLog-*/`, and the `xcrun devicectl` / `xcrun xctrace` device chain.

# xcodebuild watchOS real-device install

## When to use

User wants to push the latest `ios/TrainingLog Watch Watch App/*.swift` to their physical Apple Watch (paired with their iPhone) for smoke. e.g. just shipped D14/D15/D16 SwiftUI, just changed ContentView.swift root, just need to verify a Picker change on wrist.

If only iPhone-side TS changes (no Watch Swift touched), Metro packager + Reload JS is enough — skip this skill.

## The booby traps (validated 2026-05-29 morning, ~45 min lost; Trap 4 added 2026-05-29 afternoon)

### Trap 1 — `xcodebuild ... install` does NOT push to device

`xcodebuild -scheme TrainingLog -destination 'id=<iphone>' install` prints `** INSTALL SUCCEEDED **` but only **stages** the .app at:

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TrainingLog-*/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/TrainingLog/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/TrainingLog.app
```

The artifact never reaches the iPhone. `xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <id> | grep -i training` returns empty. User sees old version.

**Fix**: after `xcodebuild install` succeeds (or even after just `xcodebuild build`), follow with:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device <iphone-udid> \
  "<DerivedData>/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/TrainingLog/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/TrainingLog.app"
```

**Product path differs by verb (validated 2026-06-13, Y-dup Swift smoke)**: the
path above is the `install` verb's staging dir. If you ran plain `xcodebuild
… build` (NO `install` — common for a Swift-only compile-verify), there is NO
`InstallationBuildProductsLocation`; the product sits at:

```
<DerivedData>/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/TrainingLog.app
```

devicectl installs that one identically. Pick the path matching the verb you
actually ran, else `ls` returns "No such file" and you'll think the build
failed when it didn't. Embedded Watch app is at `<that .app>/Watch/TrainingLog
Watch Watch App.app` either way; verify your new Swift landed via
`strings "<…>.debug.dylib" | grep <YourNewSymbol>` (Trap 4 — a `@Published var`
name like `lastResolveMissed` shows up as a symbol; `private func` names may be
inlined away, so grep a property/type name, not a private method).

Success output looks like:
```
App installed:
? bundleID: com.lisonchang.TrainingLog
? installationURL: file:///private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/<uuid>/TrainingLog.app/
```

**Harmless warning (validated 2026-05-31, ~5 installs in one session)**: both
`devicectl device install app` and `device process launch` print a
`Failed to load provisioning paramter list due to error: …Code=1002 "No
provider was found."` line FIRST, then `App installed:` / `Launched…`. The
warning is **non-fatal** — the `App installed:` / `installationURL:` line
right after is the truth. Don't chase it; grep for
`App installed|installationURL|Launched` to detect real success.

**Locked-screen launch failure (validated 2026-06-14)**: `device process
launch` can fail with `FBSOpenApplicationErrorDomain error 7` / `…because the
device was not, or could not be, unlocked` while `install` still succeeded.
This is NOT a build/sign problem — the iPhone was just locked. Either unlock
first, or ignore it and have the user tap the app icon manually. (Install
doesn't need an unlocked device; launch does.)

Confirm via `xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <iphone-udid> | grep -i training`.

### Trap 2 — incremental build SKIPS Watch target

> If you can't find the symbol in the main binary, see Trap 4 — debug builds split it out.

If the iPhone host target has no new `.ts/.tsx/.m/.swift` touched, `xcodebuild install` decides the cached host app is fine and **never invokes Watch target compile** — even when `ios/TrainingLog Watch Watch App/*.swift` was just cherry-picked.

Symptom: `grep -E "(SwiftCompile|Watch Watch App)" build.log` → **0 matches**. The embedded `.app/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App` binary timestamp may update from codesign step, but `nm -arch arm64 <binary> | grep PickerRootView` shows only `_Preview` symbols → production ContentView still references old `dev_smoke` UI from previous build.

**Diagnostic**: check `.o` timestamps at:
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TrainingLog-*/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/TrainingLog/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/TrainingLog.build/Debug-watchos/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.build/Objects-normal/arm64/<View>.o
```
If `FinishPageView.o`/`DotsMenuView.o`/`WatchSettingsView.o` don't exist there (only `arm64_32` or `Debug-watchsimulator`), Watch target was skipped.

**Fix**: force-clean rebuild:
```bash
cd ios
xcodebuild -workspace TrainingLog.xcworkspace -scheme TrainingLog \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'id=<iphone-udid>' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  clean install
```

`clean install` forces every target (incl. Pods) to recompile. Costs 5-10 min vs 30-60s incremental. Verify success by counting Watch SwiftCompile entries:
```bash
grep -cE "SwiftCompile.*Watch Watch App" build.log
# Debug build (per-file compile): expect ≥ 20 (Watch target has ~24 .swift files)
# Release build (WMO bundled compile): expect 2-4 (one CompileSwift + one
#   SwiftCompile line per architecture: arm64_32 + arm64). The SwiftCompile
#   line lists ALL .swift files in one invocation — DON'T panic at the low
#   count, scan for your file name inside that one line instead, or check
#   `<DerivedData>/.../Release-watchos/.../Objects-normal/arm64/*.o` for
#   per-file .o output. Validated 2026-05-29 evening — first WMO smoke
#   showed grep=1 and wasted 10 min debugging until checking the .o files.
```

Then Trap 1 still applies — must `devicectl install` after `clean install`.

**Gotcha**: also note `xcodebuild` end-of-build marker for clean install is
`** INSTALL SUCCEEDED **`, NOT `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`. Monitor alternations
that grep only `BUILD SUCCEEDED|BUILD FAILED` will miss the success signal
and look like a hung build. Use `INSTALL SUCCEEDED|BUILD SUCCEEDED|BUILD FAILED|error:`
in any monitoring grep.

### Trap 3 — Apple Watch sync uses aggressive cache

Even after iPhone host app contains fresh embedded Watch bundle, the **Apple Watch sync service** on iPhone won't push it to Watch if it thinks "this version" was already installed (same `CFBundleVersion`). User sees old Watch UI.

**Symptoms tier-1**: Toggle OFF/ON in iPhone Apple Watch app → still old version. Even uninstall + reinstall via Apple Watch app UI → same old version.

**Fix (nuclear, ~3-5 min)**:
1. Long-press iPhone TrainingLog icon → **"刪除 App"** (must be Delete App, NOT just "從主畫面移除")
2. iPhone Apple Watch app → 我的手錶 → TrainingLog Watch → 滑到底 → **[移除 App]**
3. Confirm Watch home (Crown press) — TrainingLog icon should vanish
4. From CLI: `devicectl install` again (host app gone = sync service sees true new install)
5. Apple Watch app → 我的手錶 → 可用的 APP → TrainingLog Watch → **[安裝]**
6. Wait 1-3 min, Watch icon reappears, launch — should be fresh build

**Iteration tax (2026-05-29 late-evening validated, 10+ Trap 3 cycles in one session)**:

Trap 3 is required for EACH new Swift change to Watch target unless you also bump `CFBundleVersion` in `ios/TrainingLog Watch Watch App/Info.plist` (or the build setting `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`). With same version, Apple Watch sync treats every iteration as "already installed" and serves cached old code — even though the iPhone host bundle is genuinely updated by `devicectl`.

Cost: each Trap 3 cycle = ~3-5 min user time (delete + delete + wait + install + wait). For a 10-fix-iteration debug session that's 30-50 min of wall clock burned on the dance alone.

**Mitigation (IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-29, slice 13d `slice/13d-cfbundle-autobump`)**: a Run Script Build Phase named **"Bump Watch CFBundleVersion"** now runs on the Watch target every build (`alwaysOutOfDate = 1`), after the Resources phase. It calls `scripts/bump-watch-build-number.sh "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$INFOPLIST_PATH"`, which sets `CFBundleVersion` in the **built product** Info.plist to the current Unix timestamp (monotonic). Source `Info.plist` + `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` stay at `1` → **zero git churn**. Each build → higher version → Watch sync auto-pushes the fresh bundle → **Trap 3 nuclear-delete dance no longer needed** for routine Swift iteration.

- Script: `scripts/bump-cfbundle-version.sh` (target-agnostic, standalone, testable; takes `<plist-path> [value] [label]`, defaults to `date +%s`, preserves binary/xml plist format). `scripts/bump-watch-build-number.sh` is now a thin backward-compat shim delegating to it (so the Watch phase wiring is unchanged).
- pbxproj also flips `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` `YES→NO` on both Watch configs — sandboxing denied the phase's read/write of the product plist, and declaring the plist as an `outputPath` collides with Xcode's built-in Info.plist processing ("Multiple commands produce Info.plist"). Disabling matches the main TrainingLog target (already unsandboxed for RN scripts).
- Verified via `xcodebuild` (Xcode 26.4.1 / watchOS 26.4): two consecutive Watch builds → `CFBundleVersion 1 → 178007xxxx → 178007yyyy` (strictly increasing), `BUILD SUCCEEDED`, plist stays binary, `CFBundleShortVersionString` (marketing 1.0) untouched.

**HOST bump (IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-30, slice 13d `slice/13d-host-cfbundle-bump`)** — solves the *real TestFlight blocker*, NOT the Watch-sync dev loop:

The iPhone HOST app (`TrainingLog` target) `CFBundleVersion` was frozen at `1`. App Store Connect requires each upload's HOST build number to be strictly higher than the previous → the 2nd TestFlight upload was rejected with `ITMS-90478`. The Watch-only bump above does NOT cover the host, so it never fixed this.

A second Run Script Build Phase named **"Bump Host CFBundleVersion"** now runs on the HOST `TrainingLog` target every build (`alwaysOutOfDate = 1`), appended LAST (after "Embed Watch Content"). It calls `scripts/bump-cfbundle-version.sh "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$INFOPLIST_PATH" "" host`, stamping the built HOST product `Info.plist` `CFBundleVersion` with the current Unix timestamp. Mirrors the Watch phase exactly: **NO `outputPath`** (avoids "Multiple commands produce Info.plist"), writes the BUILT product only → source `ios/TrainingLog/Info.plist` + `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` stay at `1`, **zero git churn**. `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO` added explicitly to both HOST configs (Debug + Release) so the phase can write the product plist (was relying on an unspecified inherited default; now explicit, matching Watch).

- One shared script covers BOTH targets (P3 answer: yes — the logic is plist-path-agnostic; only the cosmetic echo `label` differs).
- Verified standalone + via env-simulated build-phase invocation (real `$SRCROOT`/`$TARGET_BUILD_DIR`/`$INFOPLIST_PATH`, binary product plist): `CFBundleVersion 1 → 1780073277`, binary format + marketing `1.0.0` preserved, monotonic across consecutive runs. `plutil -lint project.pbxproj` → OK.
- **Confirmed by real archive 2026-05-31** ✅ — two back-to-back Release archives gave host `CFBundleVersion` V1 `1780158818` → V2 `1780158955` (strictly increasing); the archived `TrainingLog.app/Info.plist` carried the bumped value, source plist stayed `1`, marketing `1.0.0` untouched, embedded Watch bumped too. **TestFlight `ITMS-90478` unblocked.** Use the verify recipe below — but note the two traps baked into it (the original `-sdk iphoneos` recipe was WRONG, see below).

**Morning HOST archive-verify (do before next TestFlight upload)**:
```bash
# pod install ONLY if Pods/ missing OR Podfile.lock != Pods/Manifest.lock (usually already synced — skip it).
# ⚠️ TRAP A — do NOT pass `-sdk iphoneos`: it forces the WHOLE build graph
#   (including the embedded Watch target) onto the iOS SDK, so the Watch fails to
#   compile with `WatchSettingsView.swift: no such module 'WatchKit'` → ARCHIVE FAILED.
#   Use `-destination 'generic/platform=iOS'` instead → each target keeps its own
#   SDKROOT (host→iOS, Watch→watchOS). (Validated 2026-05-31: -sdk iphoneos killed the archive.)
# ⚠️ TRAP B — a backgrounded xcodebuild does NOT inherit your foreground cwd, so pass an
#   ABSOLUTE `-workspace` path; otherwise it dies instantly with
#   `xcodebuild: error: 'TrainingLog.xcworkspace' does not exist.` (exit 66).
xcodebuild -workspace "/Users/hao800922/code/TrainingLog/ios/TrainingLog.xcworkspace" \
  -scheme TrainingLog -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  -archivePath /tmp/TL.xcarchive archive > /tmp/host-archive.log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"
# (exit code: the trailing `echo` is the wrapper's; grep the log for `** ARCHIVE SUCCEEDED **`
#  to confirm the build itself passed — a bare run_in_background EXIT can mask an archive failure.)
# 1. Confirm the phase ran:
grep -i "host: CFBundleVersion" /tmp/host-archive.log     # expect: 1 -> 17800xxxxx
# 2. Confirm the archived HOST app plist carries the bumped value:
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :CFBundleVersion' \
  "/tmp/TL.xcarchive/Products/Applications/TrainingLog.app/Info.plist"
# 3. (optional) confirm embedded Watch also bumped:
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :CFBundleVersion' \
  "/tmp/TL.xcarchive/Products/Applications/TrainingLog.app/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/Info.plist"
# Then export IPA + upload — ASC should accept the strictly-higher host build.
```
Run two archives back-to-back to prove host monotonicity (V2 > V1) before trusting the ASC re-upload.

**Standalone test recipe** (never mutate the real source plist — works for either target's plist):
```bash
cp "ios/TrainingLog/Info.plist" /tmp/copy.plist            # host (or the Watch plist)
scripts/bump-cfbundle-version.sh /tmp/copy.plist "" host   # or call bump-watch-build-number.sh
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print :CFBundleVersion" /tmp/copy.plist
```

**Caveat**: the bump lands in the built product `Info.plist` *during the build/archive* — for the HOST that DOES flow into the exported IPA, which is exactly what satisfies App Store Connect's strictly-increasing build-number rule (`ITMS-90478`). `MARKETING_VERSION` (`CFBundleShortVersionString`) still managed the normal way — only `CFBundleVersion` is auto-stamped. The Watch payoff is the dev-iteration sync loop; the HOST payoff is unblocking repeat TestFlight uploads.

### Trap 4 — Xcode 16+ debug builds split binary into stub + `.debug.dylib`

For watchOS Debug builds (and possibly iphoneos too), Xcode 16+ emits two files instead of one:

- A tiny launcher stub at `TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App` (~200KB, mostly empty `__cstring` section)
- The actual Swift code in a sibling `TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.debug.dylib` (~6-7MB)

This breaks the "verify binary contains symbol X" sanity check from Trap 2 — running `nm` or `strings` on the main binary returns ~0 useful matches even when the build was correct. You'll waste time thinking the build is broken when it's actually fine.

**Fix** — grep the `.debug.dylib` instead:

```bash
strings "$APP/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.debug.dylib" \
  | grep -i 'YourSymbolHere'
```

Or check both at once:

```bash
find "$APP" -name "*.debug.dylib" -exec strings {} \; | grep -i 'YourSymbolHere'
```

Validated 2026-05-29 ~14:00 during D29+D30 NEW-Q50 ship. The `.debug.dylib` is automatically embedded into the iPhone `.app/Watch/` bundle and installs cleanly via `devicectl` — **users don't need to do anything special**. This trap is purely a *verification* gotcha for the developer; don't waste time rebuilding the wrong file.

This is a Release-vs-Debug build difference; Release builds may still produce a single combined binary.

### Trap 5 — DDI not mounted → xcodebuild exit 70 before compiling anything (validated 2× 2026-06-11)

`xcodebuild ... install` dies in seconds with exit **70** and:

```
xcodebuild: error: Timed out waiting for all destinations matching the provided destination specifier to become available
  { platform:iOS, ..., error:The developer disk image could not be mounted on this device. }
```

(or the device vanishes from the destination list entirely, only Simulators shown). Nothing compiled — this is a CONNECTION failure, not a build failure. Diagnose with:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device info details --device <iphone-udid> 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "ddiServicesAvailable|transportType|tunnelState|developerModeStatus"
```

- `ddiServicesAvailable: false` + `transportType: localNetwork` → **iPhone on Wi-Fi; DDI mount over wireless is flaky. Fix = plug in the USB cable + unlock the phone.** Validated: DDI flipped `true` on the FIRST poll after cabling.
- `tunnelState: unavailable` → device fully disconnected (cable pulled / out of range).
- `developerModeStatus: enabled` rules out the Developer-Mode-off cause; locked screen is the other usual suspect.

**Don't sit and retry manually** — hand the user the physical action (插線+解鎖) and park a poll loop that auto-builds the moment DDI recovers:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 60); do STATE=$(xcrun devicectl device info details --device <iphone-udid> 2>/dev/null | grep -i "ddiServicesAvailable" | grep -o "true\|false"); echo "[$i] ddi=$STATE $(date +%H:%M:%S)"; if [ "$STATE" = "true" ]; then cd <repo>/ios && xcodebuild -workspace TrainingLog.xcworkspace -scheme TrainingLog -configuration Debug -destination 'id=<iphone-udid>' -destination-timeout 120 -allowProvisioningUpdates install > /tmp/watch-build.log 2>&1; echo "BUILD_EXIT=$?"; exit 0; fi; sleep 10; done; echo TIMEOUT
```

Run it `run_in_background`; also add `-destination-timeout 120` to every device build so a freshly-cabled phone has time to mount. Note exit 70 here ≠ the Trap-in-`3373fca` stale-UDID exit 70 — that one runs silent with 0 SwiftCompile; this one names the destination error explicitly.

## End-to-end recipe

```bash
# 0. Pre-flight — confirm devices connected
xcrun xctrace list devices 2>&1 | grep -iE "iPhone|Watch" | grep -v Simulator

# ⚠️ Device-ID trap (2026-05-30 validated, cost 1 wasted build + ~5 min):
#   `-destination 'id=...'` MUST be the iPhone HOST UDID — NEVER the Watch
#   UDID, NEVER an ID carried over from earlier context/memory. The Watch
#   target builds as an EMBEDDED bundle inside the host app; you never
#   target the Watch directly. A wrong/stale ID does NOT fail at compile —
#   `xcodebuild` exits 70 with a destination-resolution error and compiles
#   ZERO lines (log shows only the device list, no SwiftCompile entries).
#   Symptom: "build" finishes in seconds, `grep -c "SwiftCompile.*Watch" = 0`,
#   no INSTALL/BUILD marker. ALWAYS re-derive the iPhone UDID FRESH from the
#   line above each session — for THIS repo iPhone = `00008120-...`,
#   Watch = `00008301-...` (do not confuse). When a build looks instant,
#   FIRST check exit code + that the log has real compile lines before
#   trusting it.
#   ⚠️ 2026-06-01 reinforcement: NEVER fire `xctrace list devices` and the
#   `xcodebuild` build in the SAME parallel tool batch — you'll guess a UDID
#   and launch a wrong-id build (exit 70, 0 compile). AWAIT the UDID first.
#   And if a stale/wrong build is still running, `pkill -9 -f 'xcodebuild
#   -workspace TrainingLog'` BEFORE starting the right one — two concurrent
#   `clean install`s collide on the same DerivedData. (Cost that day: 1
#   wasted build + a collision.) The live UDID this session was
#   `00008120-00124296029B401E` (xctrace), distinct from the coredevice
#   UUID `devicectl list devices` prints — use the xctrace hardware UDID.

# 1. Clean rebuild (forces Watch target compile per Trap 2)
cd /path/to/repo/ios
xcodebuild -workspace TrainingLog.xcworkspace -scheme TrainingLog \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'id=<iphone-udid>' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  clean install 2>&1 | tee /tmp/watch-build.log

# 2. Verify Watch target really compiled
grep -cE "SwiftCompile.*Watch Watch App" /tmp/watch-build.log
# expect ≥ 20

# 3. Push to iPhone for real (per Trap 1)
APP_PATH="<DerivedData>/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/TrainingLog/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/TrainingLog.app"
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <iphone-udid> "$APP_PATH"

# 4. Verify iPhone really has it
xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <iphone-udid> | grep -i training

# 5. Launch on iPhone
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <iphone-udid> com.lisonchang.TrainingLog

# 6. If user has old Watch app installed → instruct nuclear delete per Trap 3
```

## When something looks wrong, verify in this order

1. **Did host iPhone really get the install?**
   `xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <id> | grep -i training` — empty = Trap 1
2. **Did Watch target actually compile?**
   `find <DerivedData>/.../Debug-watchos/.../Objects-normal/arm64 -name "<NewestView>.o"` — empty = Trap 2
3. **Does the binary contain production refs (not just Preview)?**
   `nm -arch arm64 <Watch binary> | grep PickerRootView | grep -v Preview | head` — empty = Trap 2 again (incremental cache)
4. **Does Apple Watch sync see new bundle?**
   `xcrun devicectl device info apps --device <watch-id> | grep -i training` — if shows old `Bundle Version`, Trap 3

   ⚠️ **The Watch `devicectl` query is FLAKY** (2026-05-30 validated, D29 smoke). The Watch is paired-via-iPhone, not directly connected, so `devicectl device info apps --device <watch-id>` intermittently returns empty OR fails with `Timed out while attempting to establish tunnel ... RemotePairingError 1001` / `CoreDeviceError 4000`. Don't trust/chase it. Instead verify **what you actually pushed** by reading the STAGED embedded Watch plist (authoritative, no device round-trip):
   ```bash
   APP="<DerivedData>/.../InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/TrainingLog.app"
   /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :CFBundleVersion' \
     "$APP/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/Info.plist"   # expect a fresh timestamp (auto-bump), >> the old on-device value
   # symbol sanity (combined binary on install builds — NOT a .debug.dylib here):
   strings "$APP/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App" | grep -ci '<YourNewType>'
   ```
   Staged plist has a bumped timestamp + the host got `devicectl install` → the Watch WILL auto-sync (CFBundleVersion auto-bump, no Trap 3 dance). If you still need to confirm on-wrist, let the smoke result be the proof (does the new behaviour show?), not the flaky query.

## Diagnosing a post-install Watch hang / crash

The traps above are about getting the build ONTO the device. Different
problem: it installed + launched fine, but the Watch app **hangs (freezes)
or crashes** at runtime. Validated 2026-05-30 (picker hang → SwiftUI
render-loop watchdog kill; root cause = a `ScrollViewReader` wrapping a
`.carousel` List — see `watch-swiftui-phase-ship` anti-patterns).

### 1. Get the report (.ips)

watchdog/hang reports don't reliably land in the Mac's
`~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/` quickly. Fastest path: on the **iPhone**,
設定 → 隱私權與安全性 → 分析與改進 → 分析資料 → newest file named
`TrainingLog Watch-…-<timestamp>.ips` → open → copy the top block. (Have
the user reproduce, wait ~30s for watchOS to kill a hung app, then grab it.)

### 2. Classify from the .ips header

- **`termination … 0x8badf00d … watchdog transgression: … exhausted real
  (wall clock) time allowance of 10.00 seconds`** → main thread
  blocked/looping >10s. `scene-update` watchdog = stuck during a SwiftUI
  render/update.
- **`WatchdogCPUStatistics: Elapsed application CPU time (seconds): N`** is
  the discriminator:
  - **high CPU (≈ the full window, e.g. 9.5s / 47%+)** → a **render LOOP** /
    runaway recompute (SwiftUI body re-evaluating forever), NOT a deadlock.
    `faultingThread` stack sits deep in `SwiftUI` / `SwiftUICore` /
    `AttributeGraph`.
  - **~0 CPU** → a **deadlock / blocked await** (lock, a WC reply that never
    comes, semaphore). Different fix class.
- A genuine crash (not hang) shows `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` / `Fatal error` + a real
  app stack frame — symbolicate it (step 3).

### 3. Symbolicate app frames (atos) + UUID match

`.ips` `usedImages` gives each image's `base`; the header gives `slice_uuid`.
The just-built Debug binary:
`<DerivedData>/…/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/TrainingLog.app/Watch/TrainingLog Watch Watch App.app/TrainingLog Watch Watch App`.

```bash
dwarfdump --uuid "<watch-binary>" | grep arm64_32   # MUST match .ips slice_uuid
atos -arch arm64_32 -o "<watch-binary>" -l <imageBase> <imageBase + imageOffset>
```

Caveat: Debug builds often have NO dSYM (DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT=dwarf) +
the installed binary may be stripped → atos returns the raw address. Then
fall back to **bisection by the "new build only" delta**: what structural
change shipped since the last working build? Revert the single strongest
suspect, `clean install`, retest. A render-loop with NO app frame in the
hot loop (all SwiftUI/AttributeGraph) means the trigger already returned —
read the recently-changed views for self-invalidation (state mutation
during body, `ScrollViewReader`+carousel, `ForEach` duplicate Identifiable
id, `onChange` that mutates its own observed value).

### 4. Private Swift symbols won't show in `strings` / `nm`

Verifying "did my new code land" via `strings <binary> | grep mySwiftFn`
FAILS for private/internal Swift methods (not `@objc` → names mangled /
absent) — don't conclude the code is missing. The reliable signal is the
**build log**: `grep -oE "MyFile\.swift" build.log` confirms it compiled, +
`** INSTALL SUCCEEDED **` with `grep -cE "SwiftCompile.*Watch Watch App"`
≥20 means the Watch target really recompiled (Trap 2).

## Not every Watch-facing fix needs this skill (JS-only shortcut)

A bug VISIBLE on the Watch is not necessarily a Watch-BINARY bug. The Watch reads its session data from the iPhone over WC, so a fix in **iPhone-side JS/TS** (handshake builders, `replaceLiveMirror`, services, `onStartFromWatch`, i18n) reflects on the Watch with just **Metro Reload JS + a fresh handshake/session** — NO rebuild, NO `devicectl`, NO Watch-sync dance. Validated 2026-05-30: the D29 "duplicate exercise" + "空白訓練" bugs both looked like Watch bugs but were fixed entirely in `src/` TS → Reload JS re-smoke each cycle (~30s vs ~10min rebuild). Only `ios/**/*.swift` changes need the full pipeline below. Before reaching for a clean install, ask: *did I touch any Swift?* If not, just Reload JS.

## RN-side caveat (related but not the same trap)

If the user opens the app and sees React Native red error page `No script URL provided`, that's Metro packager missing, NOT this skill's territory. Fix: `npx expo start --dev-client` from repo root (LAN-reachable from iPhone) → iPhone tap **Reload JS**. This is per-launch and unrelated to Watch binary state.

**"Reload JS doesn't work / Metro shows nothing when I open the app" — the installed build is RELEASE standalone (validated 2026-06-02, ~30 min lost).** A `-configuration Release` build (e.g. one made to verify #287 WC-sync, which is Release-only-verifiable) has the JS bundle **baked in** and does NOT connect to Metro — so Reload JS is impossible, shake does nothing, and pressing `r` in Metro reaches nothing. Symptom: opening the **real app icon** produces **zero** `iOS Bundling` lines in the Metro terminal. (If you DO see Bundling but with `NitroModules are not supported in Expo Go!` + `missing the required default export` errors, you opened **Expo Go** — this app's native modules can't run there; open the real `TrainingLog` icon instead, never the QR/Expo Go.) Fix to make any TS/JS change (incl. Reload-able fixes) testable: rebuild a **Debug** build (`-configuration Debug clean install` per the recipe below) + `devicectl install` — a Debug build connects to Metro on launch, then Reload JS / press `r` works. The single Debug `clean install` also re-embeds the Watch target, so it covers Swift Watch changes in the same pass. WC-sync smoke itself still must be Release standalone (separate constraint) — but you can't Reload-JS-iterate on a Release build.

## Release standalone build — sidestep Metro entirely (flaky network / hotspot)

> ⚠️⚠️ **DO NOT use a Release standalone build to smoke Watch↔iPhone WC sync — it
> BREAKS the sync (validated 2026-06-02, a full session lost to this).** Symptom:
> start a workout on the Watch → iPhone shows NOTHING (no 進行中 banner / live
> mirror / no history record on finish). The SAME code on **Debug + Metro syncs
> fine**. Ruled out, in order: stale Watch binary (clean Trap-3 reinstall of BOTH
> apps still dead), entitlements (source declares only HealthKit; WCSession needs
> no App Group; TestFlight Release proves Release-WCSession CAN work), and merged
> code (the `start-from-watch` / `handshake` SEND+RECEIVE path was UNCHANGED by
> the branches in flight — fast-lane only touched `updateLiveMirror`; superset
> only added optional passthrough fields; `addMessageListener` correctly
> multiplexes by kind). It is the **iPhone-side Release build/JS** — the WC inbound
> path (react-native-watch-connectivity event forwarding / WCSession activation)
> behaves differently under Release standalone than Debug+Metro. This is a real
> **App-Store ship-blocker** (App Store = Release) tracked separately; until it's
> root-caused, **WC-sync smoke MUST run on Debug + Metro** (Metro over the
> USB-connected Mac is stable enough even on hotspot — `curl -s
> localhost:8081/status` → `packager-status:running` to confirm Metro is up).

> Release standalone is still fine for **non-WC** smoke (UI, DB, HK, anything that
> doesn't depend on the Watch sending to the iPhone).

When the network is slow/unreliable (user on a phone hotspot, weak wifi) a Debug
dev-client smoke becomes painful: the iPhone can't reach Metro → Reload JS hangs
→ red screen `TurboModuleManager: Timed out waiting for modules to be invalidated`
(the reload tear-down times out fetching the bundle). For a smoke that does NOT
exercise WC sync, build a **Release standalone** that EMBEDS the JS bundle, so the
app needs no Metro / no network at all. Validated 2026-06-01 (hotspot device
smoke) — but see the WC-sync warning above. **Two more device-install gotchas
re-validated 2026-06-02:**
- `devicectl device install app` of the iPhone host updates ONLY the iPhone +
  its embedded Watch bundle staging — it does NOT push the new Watch app to the
  wrist (Apple Watch sync must, and is lazy). So a fresh iPhone build paired with
  a STALE Watch binary = protocol mismatch = WC dead. Confirm the Watch actually
  took the new build via an on-Watch UI marker (e.g. "does the new SupersetCard
  render?") before blaming code.
- The recurring `Failed to load provisioning paramter list … No provider was
  found.` from `devicectl install/launch/copy` is **non-fatal** — the app still
  installs (`App installed:` prints right after). Don't chase it.

Pre-flight: confirm Release signing is development (devicectl-installable), NOT
distribution-only:
```bash
cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace TrainingLog.xcworkspace -scheme TrainingLog \
  -configuration Release -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -iE "CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY|DEVELOPMENT_TEAM|PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER"
# Want: CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development + a DEVELOPMENT_TEAM, NO manual
# distribution profile. (TrainingLog: Apple Development / XQTU89U2J2 → OK.)
```
Build + verify the JS bundle is embedded (the standalone proof) + install:
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace "<abs>/ios/TrainingLog.xcworkspace" -scheme TrainingLog \
  -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates -derivedDataPath /tmp/h1-release-dd clean build \
  2>&1 | tee /tmp/release-build.log    # use generic/platform=iOS NOT -sdk iphoneos (Trap: WatchKit module err)
APP=/tmp/h1-release-dd/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/TrainingLog.app
ls -la "$APP/main.jsbundle"            # ✅ ~5MB = JS embedded → truly standalone
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <iphone-udid> "$APP"
```
Then the user just OPENS the app — no Metro, no URL, no Reload JS. (Release also
strips the dev menu → no red error screens. Good for a clean smoke; bad if you
need fast JS iteration — for that, fix the network or use `--tunnel`.) ~10 min WMO
build; run it `run_in_background: true`.

## Pull the device's SQLite DB for ground-truth debugging

When a device-only data bug appears (history corruption, lost rows) and you can't
tell render-bug vs data-bug, **pull the actual SQLite DB and SQL it** rather than
guessing. expo-sqlite stores `traininglog.db` at `Documents/SQLite/` in the app
container; development-signed apps allow container access via `devicectl`.
```bash
xcrun devicectl device copy from \
  --device <iphone-udid> \
  --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.lisonchang.TrainingLog \
  --source Documents/SQLite --destination /tmp/tl-sqlite
sqlite3 -header -column /tmp/tl-sqlite/traininglog.db "SELECT … FROM \"set\" …"
```
Traps validated 2026-06-01:
- The `Failed to load provisioning parameter list … No provider was found` line is
  a **non-fatal warning** — the copy/install still succeeds (bundleID +
  installationURL print after it). Grep it out: `grep -ivE "provisioning|No provider"`.
- **devicectl device resolution BREAKS over a phone hotspot** (`CoreDeviceError 1011
  … unable to locate a device matching … ecid_…`). The wifi/network CoreDevice
  tunnel goes stale. Fix: **connect the iPhone by USB cable** (+ unlock + trust) →
  `xcrun devicectl list devices` shows it `connected` → copy works. (Earlier
  `install` may have worked before the tunnel went stale; copy needs it live.)
- Read-only copy — does not touch the device data. Cross-session compare (multiple
  rows of the same exercise across sessions) pins intermittent corruption fast: a
  follower at a gap-ordinal / a head with 0 followers = something purged it.

## Native RN module patch + on-device WC diagnosis (#287, 2026-06-02)

When a WC-sync bug shows ONLY on a Release standalone build (Debug+Metro masks
it), you cannot Reload-JS your way out — you must build Release, get it on the
device, and read NATIVE logs. The #287 saga (`react-native-watch-connectivity`
singleton `RCTEventEmitter` buffering inbound events behind `hasObservers`):

1. **`pod install` in a non-interactive shell / worktree → `Encoding::CompatibilityError`
   ("Unicode Normalization not appropriate for ASCII-8BIT")**. CocoaPods needs a
   UTF-8 locale; the Claude Bash shell lacks one (the user's own Terminal has it
   via profile). Fix: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` before `pod install`.

2. **Headless NSLog capture without Console.app** — `xcrun devicectl device process
   launch --console --terminate-existing --device <udid> <bundleid>` as a
   **background task** streams the app's stdout/NSLog (incl. native-module
   `NSLog(@"[WC] …")`) into the task output file; `grep` it. Confirms one-vs-two
   instance via `self=%p`, `hasObservers`, `pendingEvents.count`. **Caveat: when the
   --console task ends/is-killed it TERMINATES the app** (disruptive mid-test) —
   relaunch fresh per capture, and don't rely on it staying attached.

3. **Diagnose then patch the native source in `node_modules` directly** (NOT
   patch-package yet — overnight-skill #38: node_modules is a shared symlink across
   worktrees). `git apply -p1 <diag.patch>` for behaviour-neutral `NSLog`
   instrumentation; hand-edit the fix on top. Rebuild Release (`clean build`,
   `-destination 'id=<udid>'`), `devicectl install`, capture. **Same `self=%p`
   everywhere = one instance / stale counter → emit-unconditionally fix suffices;
   different `self` in the delegate callback = two instances → route through the
   live emitter instead.** #287 was one-instance: Fix A = make `dispatchEventWithName`
   emit unconditionally + flush `pendingEvents` (RCTEventEmitter no-ops with no JS
   listener).

4. **Ship the native fix via patch-package** (survives `npm install`). User runs in
   their own Terminal: `npm install --save-dev patch-package postinstall-postinstall`.
   Then restore pristine + apply ONLY the clean fix (drop diagnostic noise):
   `rm -rf node_modules/<pkg> && npm install && git apply -p1 <fix.patch>` →
   `npx patch-package <pkg>` (writes `patches/<pkg>+<ver>.patch`) →
   `npm pkg set scripts.postinstall="patch-package"` → verify `npx patch-package`
   prints `<pkg>@<ver> ✔`. Commit `patches/` + `package.json` + `package-lock.json`.

5. **WC-sync correctness can ONLY be verified on Release standalone (no Metro)** —
   Debug+Metro's hot-reload runs extra `startObserving` cycles that flip
   `hasObservers=YES` in time, hiding the bug. But an iPhone-JS-only sync fix
   (e.g. reconcile change) is Debug+Metro + Reload-JS verifiable; a Watch-Swift or
   native-module fix needs the full Release rebuild + devicectl install.

## Cost of skipping this skill

2026-05-29 morning: ~45 min lost iterating "rebuild → user reports old Watch UI → re-investigate". Three full xcodebuild rounds (07:12, 07:36, 07:50) all printed `** INSTALL SUCCEEDED **` while iPhone had no app installed. Only at 08:00 did `devicectl install` solve Trap 1, and only after clean build at 07:50 was Watch target actually compiled (Trap 2). User then hit Trap 3 (cached old Watch UI) until iPhone host app was fully deleted at 08:30.

Don't repeat. Start with `clean install` + `devicectl install` from the start when shipping new Watch Swift code to wrist.
